    "To do a chi-square test in R, you need to have the data entered as a two-way table, which in this case you will construct directly. This skill will be helpful in the future if you ever want to do a chi-square test for any other data set; converting the raw data to a table will be easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "    • c: This command makes a column of data. So c(1,2,3) or c(\"yes\", \"no\") will put that list into a data column  that R understands.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    • matrix: This command converts a list of numbers into a matrix of numbers. For example a column of 15 numbers could be made into a 3 × 5 matrix of numbers. The command needs a column of data, the number of desired columns, and byrow=TRUE tells it to fill the data in from left to right on the rows; setting this to “FALSE” would fill it down the columns. The <- stores the matrix by that name.\n",

    "    • rownames: This command allows you to name the rows in your table, with a column\n",

    "            For example: colnames(MyMatrix) <- c(1,2,3,4)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    • as.table Finally, you can store the matrix of data as a table with row and column\n",
    "    names\n",
    "            For example: MyTable <- as.table(MyMatrix)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    • chisq.test: If you want to run a chi-square test, you simply run the command on\n",
    "    the MyTable that you’ve created\n",
    "            For example: chisq.test(MyTable)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    • prop.test: If you want to compare two proportions with a confidence interval you give a column of data for the successes and the totals. Consider one column with 15 success out of 45 and another column with 20 successes out of 40 attempts then you would use: prop.test(c(15, 20), c(45,40))"
